PB was made with usage of the SlugBase mod template, you can use it too [here](https://github.com/SlimeCubed/SlugTemplate)!

This is for the development of Rain World: Pitch Black, a mod for Rain World (Requires DLC).

Basegame and Watcher have been a huge inspiration in recent times

Started development 04/07/2023
Beta released 09/15/2023

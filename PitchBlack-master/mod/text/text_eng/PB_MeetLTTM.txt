Oh... Hello.
What are you, glowing one?
A little lantern... come to light my way?
My, at closer look, your adaptations are fascinating!
You seem perfectly adept for darkness. With those... face tendrils - could they be whiskers?
They must grant you a heightened sense of hearing.
Well, does that mean you hear it too? The song...
An inferno dances in my reflection, far off into pitch black...
With a lone star aligned, blazing, eclipsed, in the fractal night...
You look familiar, in that way.

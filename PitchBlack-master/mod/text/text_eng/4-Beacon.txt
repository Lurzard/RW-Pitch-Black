We are alike, you and I.

Unexplainable beings, rejected by realms that cannot be understood.

I've lost my hue, my luster. I've turned pale.

Memories of memories of memories, just out of reach.

I don't wish to be forgotten, but as I am now, I will be nothing more than a faded page in history.

If I was imprisoned just as you are, maybe I could be more.
